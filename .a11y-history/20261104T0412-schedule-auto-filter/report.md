## Executive summary

Pass. No critical or serious findings.

The headline numbers for this run.

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Score | 100 out of 100 |
| Grade | A |
| Findings | 0 |
| Blocking (critical plus serious) | 0 |
| Verdict | Pass |

## Severity breakdown

Counts by severity, highest impact first.

| Severity | Count | What it means |
|---|---:|---|
| critical | 0 | Blocks a person from completing the task |
| serious | 0 | Major barrier with a difficult workaround |
| moderate | 0 | Real friction, workaround exists |
| minor | 0 | Noticeable but rarely blocking |

## Findings

No findings. Every check listed under "What passed" ran and came back clean.

## Remediation priorities

Nothing to remediate.

## What passed

3 checks ran and found nothing.

- After automatic submission, JavaScript restores focus to the changed select.
- The keyboard-reachable submit buttons remain available when JavaScript is unavailable.
- The notice immediately precedes both schedule filter forms and explains that changing a filter reloads the schedule.

## Next steps

1. Keep the current checks in continuous integration so this does not regress.
2. Re-audit when the interface changes materially, or quarterly.
3. Confirm the automated result with a manual screen reader and keyboard pass.

Automated checks find a minority of accessibility barriers. A passing score is a floor, not a guarantee.
